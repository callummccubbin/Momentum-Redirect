# Momentum-Redirect
Short but challenging platformer made in Unity

Hello! This is the source code for Momentum Redirect, a platforming game with a twist that I made over the first summer of the pandemic.
It uses one unity plugin, Rule Tile, but apart from that, all code, sprites, and music is by me.
